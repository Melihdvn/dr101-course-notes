Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example the fingerposts in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in Saxony. What is traffic sign? Traffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs: Categories of signs A. Danger warning signs B. Priority signs C. Prohibitory or restrictive signs D. Mandatory signs E. Special regulation signs F. Information, facilities, or service signs G. Direction, position, or indication signs H. Additional panels History \u00b6 The earliest road signs were milestones, giving distance or direction; for example, the Romans erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. According to Strabo, Mauryas erected signboards at distance of 10 stades to mark their roads. In the Middle Ages, multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns. History \u00b6 In 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe was established by King Peter II of Portugal. This act foresaw the placement of priority signs in the narrowest streets of Lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in the neighborhood of Alfama. History \u00b6 The first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or \"ordinary\" bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads. History \u00b6 For such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines \"modern\" traffic signs. History \u00b6 The development of automobiles encouraged more complex signage systems using more than just text-based notices. One of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the Italian Touring Club in 1895. By 1900, a Congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage. In 1903 the British government introduced four \"national\" signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 International Road Congress in Paris. History \u00b6 In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating \"bump\", \"curve\", \"intersection\", and \"grade-level railroad crossing\". The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. Both Britain and the United States developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence. The UK adopted a version of the European road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, North American signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with English. History \u00b6 In the U.S., the first road signs were erected by the American Automobile Association (AAA). Starting in 1906, regional AAA clubs began paying for and installing wooden signs to help motorists find their way. In 1914, AAA started a cohesive transcontinental signage project, installing more than 4,000 signs in one stretch between Los Angeles and Kansas City alone. History \u00b6 Over the years, change was gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke-painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18 th and 19 th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20 th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols. History \u00b6 New generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for \"intelligent control\" linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input. In over 20 countries, real-time Traffic Message Channel incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via FM radio, 3G cellular data and satellite broadcasts. Finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or RFID transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring. History \u00b6 Yet another \"medium\" for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage), e.g., \"talking signs\" for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people. These are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone. History \u00b6 Then, finally, in 1914, the world's first electric traffic signal is put into place on the corner of Euclid Avenue and East 105 th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 5. Meanings of traffic signs (In Turkey) \u00b6 Traffic signs come in a variety of shapes and colours, and each has a specific meaning. The different shapes and colours are there to help you identify a sign as quickly as possible, without interrupting your driving. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, the various road traffic signs are classified into four main groups and sub-categories, for example: Warning: Road Layout/Direction of Movement Regulatory: Control/Command/Prohibition/Reservation Guidance: Location/Route Markers/Direction Temporary: Command/Prohibition Warning signs \u00b6 Warning signs \u00b6 Regulatory signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Additional signs \u00b6 Why traffic signs are important? \u00b6 Traffic signs provide valuable information to drivers and other road users. They represent rules that are in place to keep you safe, and help to communicate messages to drivers and pedestrians that can maintain order and reduce accidents. Neglecting them can be dangerous. Most signs make use of pictures, rather than words, so that they are easy to understand and can be interpreted by people who speak a variety of languages. For this reason, it\u2019s important that you know what each picture represents, and that you use them to inform your driving. Failing to do so could result in a serious accident or a fine.

Some cars will have electronic controls (usually on the left side of the seat), while older cars will usually have a lever underneath the seat that lets you control the position of the seat. But you can usually tell the difference. Familiarize yourself with the foot pedals. \u00b6 In an automatic car, the two-foot pedals control acceleration and braking, respectively. The rightmost pedal (which is usually smaller than the other pedal) is the accelerator, and pressing down on it makes the car move; the harder you press down on it, the faster the car will move. The pedal to the left, which is usually larger than the accelerator; is the brake pedal, and pressing down on it slows the car down. Even if you feel more confident using your left foot, always use your right foot to reach both pedals. It will feel strange at first if you're left-footed, but getting used to it is very important because it's proper technique and ultimately much safer. Never use both feet at once to reach the pedals. Only use one foot \u2014 your right foot \u2014 to use each pedal. This will make it impossible to accidentally press down on both pedals at the same time, which can be dangerous and can damage your car. Adjust your car's mirrors so that you can see through them clearly and effectively. \u00b6 Your car should have three mirrors: one rear-view mirror, which allows you to see directly the rear windshield behind you, and two outside mirrors which let you see to either side of the car and protect you from blind spots. - Your rear-view mirror should be positioned so that when you're in your normal driving position, you can see directly behind you and as much of the rear windshield as possible. The Society of Automotive Engineers has one recommendation for how to position your outside mirrors in order to eliminate blind spots. It recommends positioning the mirrors further outward than normal, so that they just overlap with the viewing angle of the rear-view mirror. Although disorienting at first, this positioning actually allows the driver to see cars in their blind spots which they might otherwise only be able to spot by looking over their shoulder. Know where the parking brake (also called a handbrake, e-brake or emergency brake) is and what it does. \u00b6 The parking brake is a longer lever with a button on the very tip of it. When the parking brake is pulled up, it helps lock the car into place on the ground, ensuring that it doesn't move. When the brake is let down, it is disengaged and the car can freely move. Make sure that your parking brake is disengaged before you start driving. Get a feel for the gear stick (also called shift lever, gear lever, shifter or simply, \"the stick\") \u00b6 he gear stick is usually positioned in between the two front seats of a car, and it controls the gearbox (park, neutral, drive, reverse). Sometimes in certain vehicles, the shift lever is on the right side of the steering wheel. - If your gear stick is engaged in Park and you turn your ignition on, the car won't move forward no matter how hard you press down on the accelerator. - If your gear stick is in Neutral, your car's natural momentum will continue to move it forward. If your gear stick is in Reverse, your car will move backward instead of forward when you take your foot off the brake. If your gear stick is in Drive, your car will move forwards when you take your foot off the brake. In most modern vehicles, the lever is either in a straight line on the right side of the driver or is a lever on the steering wheel. The \"lever\" may actually be a knob depending on your car. If you're stuck, read the owners manual when you have the time. Understand the basic dashboard controls/symbols. \u00b6 These gauges display to the driver how much fuel the engine has left, how fast the car is going, how hot the engine is, and how many RPM (revolutions per minute) the engine is clocking. - The speedometer is probably the most important dashboard display in the car. It tells you how fast your car is traveling, in either miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per hour (kph). - The RPM gauge tells you how hard your engine is working. Most RPM gauges will have red areas starting at 6,000 or 7,000 RPM. When the dial in the gauge, travels into the red, learn to ease off the acceleration. The fuel gauge tells you how much fuel your car has left. It usually has a dial, like the hand of a clock that travels between \"F\" and \"E,\" with \"E\" signaling \"empty\" and \"F\" signaling \"full.\" Some more modern cars have digital fuel gauges; where electronic bars are displayed like the battery symbol on a mobile phone, and gradually decrease in quantity depending on how much fuel is in the car. The temperature gauge in the car tells you whether your car's engine is overheating. It usually has a dial that travels between \"H\" and \"C,\" signaling \"hot\" and \"cold.\" Your dial should normally be in the center of the gauge.

Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example the fingerposts in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in Saxony. What is traffic sign? Traffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs: Categories of signs A. Danger warning signs B. Priority signs C. Prohibitory or restrictive signs D. Mandatory signs E. Special regulation signs F. Information, facilities, or service signs G. Direction, position, or indication signs H. Additional panels History \u00b6 The earliest road signs were milestones, giving distance or direction; for example, the Romans erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. According to Strabo, Mauryas erected signboards at distance of 10 stades to mark their roads. In the Middle Ages, multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns. History \u00b6 In 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe was established by King Peter II of Portugal. This act foresaw the placement of priority signs in the narrowest streets of Lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in the neighborhood of Alfama. History \u00b6 The first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or \"ordinary\" bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads. History \u00b6 For such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines \"modern\" traffic signs. History \u00b6 The development of automobiles encouraged more complex signage systems using more than just text-based notices. One of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the Italian Touring Club in 1895. By 1900, a Congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage. In 1903 the British government introduced four \"national\" signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 International Road Congress in Paris. History \u00b6 In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating \"bump\", \"curve\", \"intersection\", and \"grade-level railroad crossing\". The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. Both Britain and the United States developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence. The UK adopted a version of the European road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, North American signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with English. History \u00b6 In the U.S., the first road signs were erected by the American Automobile Association (AAA). Starting in 1906, regional AAA clubs began paying for and installing wooden signs to help motorists find their way. In 1914, AAA started a cohesive transcontinental signage project, installing more than 4,000 signs in one stretch between Los Angeles and Kansas City alone. History \u00b6 Over the years, change was gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke-painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18 th and 19 th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20 th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols. History \u00b6 New generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for \"intelligent control\" linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input. In over 20 countries, real-time Traffic Message Channel incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via FM radio, 3G cellular data and satellite broadcasts. Finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or RFID transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring. History \u00b6 Yet another \"medium\" for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage), e.g., \"talking signs\" for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people. These are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone. History \u00b6 Then, finally, in 1914, the world's first electric traffic signal is put into place on the corner of Euclid Avenue and East 105 th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 5. Meanings of traffic signs (In Turkey) \u00b6 Traffic signs come in a variety of shapes and colours, and each has a specific meaning. The different shapes and colours are there to help you identify a sign as quickly as possible, without interrupting your driving. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, the various road traffic signs are classified into four main groups and sub-categories, for example: Warning: Road Layout/Direction of Movement Regulatory: Control/Command/Prohibition/Reservation Guidance: Location/Route Markers/Direction Temporary: Command/Prohibition Warning signs \u00b6 Warning signs \u00b6 Regulatory signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Guidance signs \u00b6 Additional signs \u00b6 Why traffic signs are important? \u00b6 Traffic signs provide valuable information to drivers and other road users. They represent rules that are in place to keep you safe, and help to communicate messages to drivers and pedestrians that can maintain order and reduce accidents. Neglecting them can be dangerous. Most signs make use of pictures, rather than words, so that they are easy to understand and can be interpreted by people who speak a variety of languages. For this reason, it\u2019s important that you know what each picture represents, and that you use them to inform your driving. Failing to do so could result in a serious accident or a fine.

Some cars will have electronic controls (usually on the left side of the seat), while older cars will usually have a lever underneath the seat that lets you control the position of the seat. But you can usually tell the difference. Familiarize yourself with the foot pedals. \u00b6 In an automatic car, the two-foot pedals control acceleration and braking, respectively. The rightmost pedal (which is usually smaller than the other pedal) is the accelerator, and pressing down on it makes the car move; the harder you press down on it, the faster the car will move. The pedal to the left, which is usually larger than the accelerator; is the brake pedal, and pressing down on it slows the car down. Even if you feel more confident using your left foot, always use your right foot to reach both pedals. It will feel strange at first if you're left-footed, but getting used to it is very important because it's proper technique and ultimately much safer. Never use both feet at once to reach the pedals. Only use one foot \u2014 your right foot \u2014 to use each pedal. This will make it impossible to accidentally press down on both pedals at the same time, which can be dangerous and can damage your car. Adjust your car's mirrors so that you can see through them clearly and effectively. \u00b6 Your car should have three mirrors: one rear-view mirror, which allows you to see directly the rear windshield behind you, and two outside mirrors which let you see to either side of the car and protect you from blind spots. - Your rear-view mirror should be positioned so that when you're in your normal driving position, you can see directly behind you and as much of the rear windshield as possible. The Society of Automotive Engineers has one recommendation for how to position your outside mirrors in order to eliminate blind spots. It recommends positioning the mirrors further outward than normal, so that they just overlap with the viewing angle of the rear-view mirror. Although disorienting at first, this positioning actually allows the driver to see cars in their blind spots which they might otherwise only be able to spot by looking over their shoulder. Know where the parking brake (also called a handbrake, e-brake or emergency brake) is and what it does. \u00b6 The parking brake is a longer lever with a button on the very tip of it. When the parking brake is pulled up, it helps lock the car into place on the ground, ensuring that it doesn't move. When the brake is let down, it is disengaged and the car can freely move. Make sure that your parking brake is disengaged before you start driving. Get a feel for the gear stick (also called shift lever, gear lever, shifter or simply, \"the stick\") \u00b6 he gear stick is usually positioned in between the two front seats of a car, and it controls the gearbox (park, neutral, drive, reverse). Sometimes in certain vehicles, the shift lever is on the right side of the steering wheel. - If your gear stick is engaged in Park and you turn your ignition on, the car won't move forward no matter how hard you press down on the accelerator. - If your gear stick is in Neutral, your car's natural momentum will continue to move it forward. If your gear stick is in Reverse, your car will move backward instead of forward when you take your foot off the brake. If your gear stick is in Drive, your car will move forwards when you take your foot off the brake. In most modern vehicles, the lever is either in a straight line on the right side of the driver or is a lever on the steering wheel. The \"lever\" may actually be a knob depending on your car. If you're stuck, read the owners manual when you have the time. Understand the basic dashboard controls/symbols. \u00b6 These gauges display to the driver how much fuel the engine has left, how fast the car is going, how hot the engine is, and how many RPM (revolutions per minute) the engine is clocking. - The speedometer is probably the most important dashboard display in the car. It tells you how fast your car is traveling, in either miles per hour (mph) or kilometers per hour (kph). - The RPM gauge tells you how hard your engine is working. Most RPM gauges will have red areas starting at 6,000 or 7,000 RPM. When the dial in the gauge, travels into the red, learn to ease off the acceleration. The fuel gauge tells you how much fuel your car has left. It usually has a dial, like the hand of a clock that travels between \"F\" and \"E,\" with \"E\" signaling \"empty\" and \"F\" signaling \"full.\" Some more modern cars have digital fuel gauges; where electronic bars are displayed like the battery symbol on a mobile phone, and gradually decrease in quantity depending on how much fuel is in the car. The temperature gauge in the car tells you whether your car's engine is overheating. It usually has a dial that travels between \"H\" and \"C,\" signaling \"hot\" and \"cold.\" Your dial should normally be in the center of the gauge.
